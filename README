# Messaging App

## Setup

```sh
cd react-native-messaging
yarn
yarn start
```

## Development

### Note

- The App under `Stream Dashboard` must under `development` rather than `production`.
  - Change `ZenSoft` Stream App to development (Solved).
  - The `chatApiKey` is Stream App `App Access Keys` - `Key` rather than `Secret`.
  - The `chatUserToken` is generate by backend server, rather than customise a JWT token.
    - This is not very clear, need to explore more.
    - To successfully add/connect a user we should disable the `Stream App Auth` under App's dashboard (solved).
